# ANALYSING INSULINE WITH PYTHON
Retrieve the protein sequence of human insulin from human preproinsulin

## Bonus
Cleaning preproinsulin-seq.txt programmatically
try using regex to strip the file of ORIGIN, its numbers,  the two slashes (//), spaces, and line breaks or return carriages.
You could also confirm programmatically that the file has 110 characters

Use Python, Bash, or manual manipulation to retrieve only those amino acids in the sequence that compose insulin
