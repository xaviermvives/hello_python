# LOOPS
A loop is a segment of code that repeats. You will be introduced to two types of loops: the while loop and the for loop.

- use a 'while' loop
- use a 'for' loop

OTHER
'random' module to generate random numbers
input() -> gets data from user, as a string data type
int() -> to convert into integer 
range() ->takes a starting number and an ending number, but the ending number is not inclusive

A 'while' loop makes a section of code repeat until a certain condition is met.

TASK 1:
create a Python script that asks the user to correctly guess a number.

TASK 2:
using a 'for' loop to print a range of numbers
