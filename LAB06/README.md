comma-separated values (csv) is a file format used to store tabular data, such as data from a spreadsheet

reading files with the module 'csv'
making a copy with the module 'copy'

items() function ->belongs to the dictionary data type
in a for loop, traverse the collection of items

'with open' syntax statement
-> keep a file open while you read data

csv.reader()  -> a function from the csv library
